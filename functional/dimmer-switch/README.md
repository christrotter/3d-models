# Overview
Well this is an embarassingly overcomplicated way of having a neat dimmer switch.

See build log for details: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfFv9DOLeLpUt-6bEELfBpDM5MGb3Iz7f_fSFY1v8uA/edit?usp=sharing

Did I get carried away?  Perhaps.  Is it a pretty janky execution-of-concept?  Perhaps.
But does it work as a dimmer switch? 100%.  And does it look neat?  Good in my books!

Should you build this?  100000% no.
